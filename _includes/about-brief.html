                    <p>Avinash (Avi) Karn is a quantitative geneticist, plant breeder and agronomist. He is currently a postdoctoral research scientist at Carl Woese Institute of Genomics Biology in the University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign working on NSF funded PGRP grant to study genetic architecture of maize roots and its influence on uptake efficiency of various micronutrients.  
                    He is a native of Nepal, he came to the US in January of 2008 at Truman State University in Kirksville, Missouri, where he completed his B.Sc. in Agricultural science, emphasizing in plant breeding and genetics. After the
                    completion of his B.Sc. degree, he received  Dr. Marcus Zuber endowement fellowship to pursue his doctoral study at the University of Missouri-Columbia in the area of plant breeding, genetics and genomics with Dr. Sherry Flint-Garcia (USDA-ARS, Research Geneticist). In his PhD dissertation, he worked with populations derived from maize and teosinte, aiming to discover novel alleles for kernel composition and, novel epistatic interactions to improve various agronomic and geo-climatic adaptation traits in crops.
                    Avi intends to use his education and training in pursuing a career in a research organization that is involved to improve human nutrition, health and environment for both developed and developing communities.</p>
